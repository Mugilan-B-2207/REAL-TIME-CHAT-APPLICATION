The back end, built using Node.js, handles WebSocket connections and facilitates seamless communication between users by broadcasting messages to all connected clients. The application also includes a feature to display message history, ensuring users can view previous conversations. By combining efficient front-end design with WebSocket's real-time capabilities, the application delivers an interactive, fast, and user-friendly chat experience.
